This is a collection of Godot examples I either program myself, or replicate from other tutorials. Mainly made for me and my mutuals whom which we all are currently beginners, but decided to make it public for anyone to use.

So far, there are examples such as:
 - 2D Top Down Movement (🟢)
 - 3D Third Person Movement (🟢)
 - Main Menu (🟡)
 - 3D First Person Movement (🔴)

(Finished 🟢 / Finished, but could use some work 🟡 / Work In Progress 🟠 / Planned 🔴)
